    question: "What should I wear hiking if it's really hot?",
    answer: [
      `Great question! If it's hot outside, you'll want to wear lightweight 
  and breathable clothing that will help keep you cool and comfortable on your hike.`,
      `Some good options might include shorts, sportswear t-shirts, or tank tops, and 
  moisture-wicking socks. You'll also want comfortable and supportive hiking s
  hoes or boots to protect your feet on rough terrain. Be sure to bring a hat and sunglasses 
  to protect your face and eyes from the sun, and don't forget to apply sunscreen before you hit the trail!`,

    question: `It might be raining too`,
    answer: [
      `Both hot and rainy can be a little tricky. You'll want to 
  make sure that you are covered up and dry in case it starts to rain, but that your clothes are 
  also breathable enough to allow sweat to escape so you don't overheat:`,

      `Wear lightweight, quick-drying fabrics such as polyester or nylon.`,
      `A rain jacket or poncho will help keep you dry.`,
      `A hat with a brim can a keep the sun and rain out of your face.`,
      `Waterproof or water-resistant footwear with
 good traction is key, especially if you will be walking on slippery or muddy terrain.`,
      `Finally, pack extra dry clothing in your 
 backpack in case you need to change into something warmer and dry during a break.`,

      ` Maybe try these:`,
